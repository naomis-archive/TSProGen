## Installing the Tool

Run the following command in your terminal to install the CLI tool:

```bash
npm install -g tsprogen
```

## Running the Tool

With your terminal pointed at your root project directory (where you want the files generated), use this command:

```bash
tsprogen
```

This will generate the initial file structure for your project.

## Testing Your New Project

To test your new project, you will need to build and start the script. If you do not have TypeScript installed globally, run `npm install typescript`. Then use the following script to build the files:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the server, use:

```bash
npm run start
```

You should see "index.ts works!" in your console - congratulations! Your project is ready for development!
